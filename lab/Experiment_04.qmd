# Experiment 4 - Design of Analog Filters

## Brief theory and motivation
Second order filters (or biquard filters) are important since they are the building blocks in the construction of $N^{th}$
order filters, for $N > 2$. When $N$ is odd, the $N^{th}$ order filter can be realized using $N - 1$ second order
filters and one first order filter. When $N$ is even, we need $N-1$ second order filters. Please listen to the recorded
lecture at [19] for a detailed explanation of active filters.

Second order filter can be used to construct four different types of filters. The transfer functions for the different
filter types are shown in @tab-filter_tf, where	$f_0 = \frac{1}{2 \pi RC} and $H_0$ is the low frequency gain of the transfer
function. The filter names are often abbreviated as LPF (lowpass filter), HPF (highpass filter), BPF (bandpass filter),
and BSF (bandstop filter). 

In this experiment, we will describe a universal active filter, which provides all four filter functionalities.
@fig-lab-04-biquad shows a second order universal filter realized using two integrators. Note that there are
different outputs of the circuit that realize LPF, HPF, BPF and BSF functions.

### Transfer funtions of active filters

* Lowpass Filter (LPF):

$$
\frac{V_{03}}{V_i} = \frac{H_0}
{\left( 1 + \frac{s}{\omega_0 Q} + \frac{s^2}{\omega^2_0} \right)}
$$

* Highpass Filter (HPF):

$$
\frac{V_{01}}{V_i} = \frac{\left( H_0 \frac{s^2}{\omega_0^2} \right)}
{\left( 1 + \frac{s}{\omega_0 Q} + \frac{s^2}{\omega^2_0} \right)}
$$

* Bandpass Filter (BPF):

$$
\frac{V_{02}}{V_i} = \frac{\left( -H_0 \frac{s}{\omega_0} \right)}
{\left( 1 + \frac{s}{\omega_0 Q} + \frac{s^2}{\omega^2_0} \right)}
$$

* Bandstop Filter (BSF):

$$
\frac{V_{01}}{V_i} = \frac{H_0 \left( 1 + \frac{s^2}{\omega_0^2} \right)}
{\left( 1 + \frac{s}{\omega_0 Q} + \frac{s^2}{\omega^2_0} \right)}
$$

## Specification

Design a band-pass (BPF) and a band-stop (BSF) filter. 
* For the BPF, assume $f_0 = 1\,kHz$ and $Q=1$.
* For the BSF, assume $f_0 = 10\,kHz$ and $Q=10$.


## Measurements to be taken

### Steady-state response 
Apply a square wave input (Try $f$ = 1 kHz and $f$ = 10 kHz to both BPF and BSF circuits and observe the outputs.
   
* Band-pass output will output the fundamental frequency of the square wave multiplied by the gain at the centre
  frequency. The amplitude at this frequency is given by $\frac{4 V_p}{\pi H_0 Q}$, where $V_p$ is the peak
  amplitude of the input square wave. 
 
* The band-stop filterâ€™s output will carry all the harmonics of the square wave, other than fundamental. This
  illustrates the application of BSF as a distortion analyzer. 

### Frequency response 
Apply a sine wave input and obtain the magnitude and the phase response.

## What you should submit

### Simulation with KiCad (ngspice)
Simulate the circuits and obtain the steady-state response and frequency response.

### Measurements with Redpitaya STEMlab
Take the plots of the steady-state and frequency response with STEMlab oscilloscope or SCPI and compare it with
simulation results. For frequency response, apply a sine wave input and vary its input frequency to obtain the phase and
magnitude error.

## Exercise Set 4

### 3rd order butterworth
Higher order filters are normally designed by cascading second order filters and, if needed, one first-order filter.
Design a third order Butterworth lowpass filter using Python or Matlab and obtain the frequency response as well as the
transient response of the filter. The specifications are bandwidth of the filter $f_0 = 10\,kHz$ and gain $H_0=10$.

### Notch filter
Design a notch filter (band-stop filter) to eliminate the $50\,H$z power life frequency. In order to test this circuit,
synthesize a waveform $v(t) = \sin(100\pi t) + 0.1 \sin(200 \pi t)$ Volts and use it as the input to the filter. 
What output did you obtain?
