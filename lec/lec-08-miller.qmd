# Issue



* We could now in principle use this expression to plot the frequency response of the circuit and compute the 3\-dB bandwidth
  * The result would match the Spice simulation result exactly
* There are two issues with going in this direction for hand analysis
  * The procedure is quite tedious…
    * Imagine how complex the equations would get for a multi\-transistor circuit
  * The derived expression is  _useless for reasoning_  about the circuit from an intuitive design perspective
    * By looking at this equation we cannot easily tell what exactly limits the bandwidth\, or how we can improve it

# Simulation Result from Last Lecture



* Want to have a method that let’s us estimate the dominant pole quickly using intuitive methods
  * Without running into high entropy expressions that tell us things we are not interested in…
* Non\-dominant\, high\-frequency poles and zeros may or may not be important
  * If they are\, it may be OK to do a little more work \(see material on feedback circuits\, later in this course\)


Non\-dominant pole\(s\) and zero\(s\)

# The Culprit

The main reason for the high complexity in the derived expression is that Cgd “couples” nodes 1 and 2

For Cgd=0\, the circuit becomes

* Let’s us refer the coupling impedance to grounded equivalent impedances on both sides
  * But requires the knowledge of K = V2/V1

* Note that this case is similar to our CS amplifier example
  * The CS amplifier has negative voltage gain\, and this gain appears across Cgd
* One subtlety\, however\, is that the gain across Cgd is frequency dependent \(K is not constant\)
  * Let’s take a careful look at that

# Miller Approximation

It is appropriate to approximate

Approximating the gain term K\(s\) with its low\-frequency value is called the Miller approximation\.

# Resulting Circuit Model

This circuit model suggests that there are two poles

The pole p2 lies beyond the frequency range for which this model is valid; it must be discarded

# How about p1?



* Whether or not these inequalities hold depends on the parameter  _values_  that apply to the specific circuit in question
* In our example\, we have
  * Ri=50kΩ >> R=5kΩ\, gmR≅5\, Cgs > Cdb\, Cgd
* Conditions are met\!

# Conclusions (1)



* The Miller approximation is a great tool that allows us to calculate the bandwidth of our CS circuit example on the “back of an envelope”
* An important caveat is that the Miller approximation is only useful as long as the dominant time constant is with the input network of the circuit \(node 1\)
  * Usually the case when Ri is large\, and there is no large capacitance attached to vo
* For calculations\, you will typically start by assuming that this condition is met\, and later check and make sure that the obtained dominant pole frequency lies indeed far below the pole\(s\) and zero\(s\) of K\(s\)
  * With a little bit of experience you will be able to do this by “inspection”

* Very important
  * The Miller approximation allows quick calculation of the dominant pole frequency only
  * It is unsuitable for estimating the non\-dominant pole frequency
