# The "Atoms" of Analog Circuit Design



* As we've seen from the discussion so far\, a common source stage is sufficient for building a simple amplifier
  * How about the other two possible configurations?
* We'll find that common gate and drain stages can be incorporated as valuable add\-ons\, for building "better" amplifiers
* Interestingly\, many analog circuits can be decomposed into a combination of the above three fundamental building blocks

# Bulk Connection

<span style="color:#cc0000">\*</span>  _Be aware_ :

Ask the tech\. folks

Know what it means\!

In the Colorado \(N\-well\) technology\, only the PMOS device has an isolated bulk connection

Newer technologies <span style="color:#cc0000">\*</span>  \(e\.g\. 0\.13μm CMOS\) also tend to have NMOS devices with isolated bulk \("tripple\-well" process\)

# PMOS Well Capacitance



* In the ANS \(N\-well\) technology\, the PMOS transistor is a 5 terminal device
  * G\, D\, S\, B\, Substrate
* N\-well forms a PN junction with the substrate
  * Often "AC shorted" when N\-well=VDD\,  <span style="color:#cc0000">Substrate=GND</span>
  * _Not shorted_  when we connect N\-well to source\!
    * Resulting capacitance ~ 0\.05 fF/μm2 \(needs to be cross checked in AMS\)
    * Not modeled in Spice\! Must  _add extra diode_  manually in this case

# Backgate Effect (1)



* With positive VSB\, depletion region around source grows
* Increasing amount of negative fixed charge in depletion region tends to "repel" electrons coming from source
  * Need larger VGS to compensate for this effect \(I\.e\. Vt increases\)


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

This effect is usually factored in as an effective increase in Vt

Detailed analysis shows



* A change in Vt also means a change in drain current
  * Define small\-signal  _backgate_  transconductance

# CG Summary



* Current gain is unity up to very high frequencies
  * Our "simple" device model predicts up to roughly fT
* Input impedance is very low
  * At least when the output is also terminated with some reasonable impedance
* Can achieve very high output resistance
* In summary\, a common gate stage is ideal for turning a decent current source into a much better one
  * Seems like this is something we can use to improve our common source stage
    * Which is indeed nothing but a decent \(voltage controlled\) current source

# Cascode Stage--Preview of Cascading



* An important\, extremely useful application of Common Gate
  * http://web\.mit\.edu/klund/www/cascode\.html


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# High Frequency Benefits



* Very close to \-1\, for moderate values of RL
  * Mitigates Miller effect
  * Even if R is large\, there is often a load capacitance that provides a low impedance termination to help maintain this feature
* Additional benefit
  * Cascode mitigates direct forward coupling from Vi to Vo at high frequencies


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Example Revisited



* What we expect to see in Spice after adding the cascode device
  * Bandwidth should increase \(reduction of Miller effect\)
    * Easy to see using a ZVTC analysis\, see homework
  * Non\-dominant pole around some fraction of fT of cascode device
    * Drain current of MN1 runs into a current divider between 1/g’mc and total capacitance at this node \(dominated by Cgs of MNC\)

# Supply Headroom Issue



* Even if we adjust VBCAS such that VDS1 is small\, adding a cascode reduces the available signal swing
* This can be a big issue when designing circuits with VDD≅1V
  * Typically need each VDS>~0\.2V
