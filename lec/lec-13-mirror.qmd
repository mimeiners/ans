# Lecture 13Current Mirrors

# Basic Analysis



* M1 “computes” gate\-source voltage
* M2 sees same VGS\, and therefore IO=II \(to first order\)
  * Note that this result holds even with large variations in Vt or μCox that are common to M1 and M2

# Typical Design Objectives



* Minimize error in IO
* Minimize compliance voltage Vomin
* Minimize capacitance Co
* Maximize Ro
* Want to be able to scale currents\, i\.e\. IO=K×II

# Current Scaling (1)



* The above equation suggests that we can set K by scaling either or both the widths and lengths of the two MOSFETS
  * This deserves a closer look

* The solid curve to the right shows how the current of a modern MOSFET changes with 1/L
* Very different from our long channel model\, which predicts ID~1/L
* Bottom line
  * Impossible to make current mirrors with reasonable accuracy unless L1=L2

The remaining \(and only option\) for scaling the current is to use devices with different widths

Basic possibility from a layout perspective \(e\.g\. K=2\)

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

Unfortunately\, transistors in modern technology do not resemble the rectangular boxes drawn on the previous slide

Doubling the “drawn” width may not double the current

The best we can do in this situation is to work with a number of unit devices that have the same nominal width

# Aside: Shared Drain Regions



* Sometimes desirable \(and OK\) to share drain regions of unit devices
  * Reduces junction capacitance

# Error Sources



* Systematic
  * VDS2 ≅ VDS1
  * IR drop in source connection
* Random
  * Mismatch in Vt
  * Mismatch in μCoxW/L


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Inaccuracy due to ΔVDS



* Example: λ=0\.1V\-1\, ΔVDS=1V\, ε=10%
* Two options
  * Use device with small λ \(large L\)
  * Minimize ΔVDS


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# IR Drop in Source Connection



* Want large VOV to mitigate errors due to wire IR drop
  * Unfortunately this means large Vomin \(Vomin=VDSsat=VOV\)
* Example: Vwire=10mV\, VOV=200mV  ε=10% \(\!\)

# Inaccuracy Due to Random Mismatch

Example: VOV=200mV\, W=20μm\, L=1μm

# Higher Ro

Can use cascode configuration to achieve very large Ro

Even though the resistance is now high at the output node\, we still need  VX=VI to minimize the systematic errors due to ΔVDS between M1 and M2

# Solution 1



* Note that ε≈0 in this configuration
  * Why?
  * Vx is a low impedance node\.


Issue: Vomin is relatively large

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Solution 2

Use some kind of "magic battery" that sets the cascode gate potential such that Vomin = 2VOV \(minimum possible\)

"High swing" bias

# Magic Battery 1



* Gate overdrive of ¼ device is twice as large as VOV of all other devices
  * VCAS=Vt\+2VOV
  * Vomin = 2VOV
* Sensitive to back\-gate effect


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.



* Less sensitive to back\-gate effect
* Stacked device mimics transistor with length 4L
  * May not match characteristics of devices with length L all that well
  * In practice\, designers tend to use “W/3 device” for the bottom three devices in the stack

# Current Distribution (1)



* Typically\, we'll only have one \(or a few\) reference current generators on a chip
* Can generate/distribute currents across chip in two different ways
  * Distribute gate voltage
    * Can cause big problems\, e\.g\. due to IR drop and process gradients across the chip
    * Usually limited to local distribution
  * Distribute currents
    * Have one global bias cell close to reference that sends currents into local biasing sub\-circuits
    * Disadvantage: consumes additional current

* Since current distribution tends to “waste” some current in auxiliary branches\, one is often tempted to use large mirror ratios \(K\)
* This can be troublesome for several reasons
  * Consider e\.g\. the time constant at node VI
  * R = 1/gm\, C ≅ \(1\+K\)Cgs
  * RC ≅ \(1\+K\)Cgs/gm = \(1\+K\)/ωT
  * If disturbed\, node VI will take a long time to settle when K is large
* ANS rule
  * K>20 is forbidden

# Current Scaling (5)

Spice:    M1 d g s b w=10u l=1u    M2 d g s b   w=10u l=1u  <span style="color:#ff0000"> __m=2__ </span>



* Rule
  * Current mirrors must be built using unit devices \(use m\-factor in spice netlists\)
  * Note that this restricts the scale factor to a rational number K=P/Q\, where P and Q are integers

# Magic Battery 2 (more details)

Two drain currents must be equal;  W/L and operating conditions different

| k= | VB= |
| :-: | :-: |
| 3 | 2VOV\+VT |
| 5 | 2\.45VOV\+VT |
| 8 | 3VOV\+VT |

# Magic Battery 3

Pro: no extra current branch

Con: needs lots of voltage headroom on input side

Sensitive to back\-gate effect

* The previous circuits assumed that Lmirror=Lcascode
  * Sometimes want Lmirror≠Lcascode
* The above circuit makes Vcas =Vt2 \+ VOV2 \+ VOV1
  * Vomin becomes VOV2 \+ VOV1\, as desired
