# Lecture 14 Supply Insensitive Bias Current Generation

# Poor Man's Bias



* Issue: Current is essentially proportional to VDD
  * E\.g\. if VDD varies by X%\, bias current will roughly vary by the same amount

# "Vt" Referenced Bias

By using a sufficiently large device\, we can make VOV < Vt\, and achieve

Question: By how much will IOUT change given some variation in VDD?

# Sensitivity

The sensitivity of a parameter y to a change in parameter x can be approximately found using

In our case\, we are looking for

Not bad\, but also not all that great…

# Self Biasing

In the circuit discussed on the previous slides\, the supply sensitivity is still fairly high\, because IIN is essentially directly proportional to VDD

Idea: Mirror output current back to input instead of using supply dependent input current\!

# Start-Up Circuit



* Unfortunately\, self\-biasing comes with a built in "chicken and egg problem"
  * There exists a stable operating point with all currents =0
  * Can use a simple start\-up circuit to solve this problem

The transconductance of M1 is



* Transconductance of M1 and other devices biased using this circuit depend only on m and R2\!
  * This is why this bias circuit is more appropriately called "constant gm reference"
* Design aspects
  * Can use off\-chip resistor to set gm precisely
  * Large VOV helps reduce mismatch errors
  * Small IR2 makes circuit less sensitive to back\-gate effect

# Substrate PNP

A special twist that the technology provides: a three\-terminal bipolar device with the collector \(“C”\) always connected to substrate

_Notation_  for terminals: “E”  _emits_  carriers \(holes\); “B” is the  _base_  bias terminal and “C”  _collects_  the majority of the emitted carriers \(via the shaded junction region\)\.

# The Problem with This Circuit



* Process and temperature variations cause large changes in Vt and mobility \(μ\)
  * But VI is kept constant\, causing large changes in ID\, forcing the device into the triode region
* First cut idea
  * Use another MOSFET to “compute” VI such that ID stays roughly constant and tracks process and temperature
  * Note that the same “trick” is used in a current mirror


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# First Cut Solution



* What we expect to see in simulation
  * VI \(=VGS1=VGS2\) changes with process and temperature
  * But ID1 and VO stay roughly constant

# Remaining Issue



* What if we do not have access to the “\-” node of the input transducer?
  * Consider e\.g\. a sensor or an another amplifier that produces a ground referenced signal with “arbitrary” quiescent voltage


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# AC Coupling



* Issues
  * Don’t like Rlarge\, Clarge in integrated circuits
  * Ri and Rlarge form a resistive divider
    * Problematic if Ri is large


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Another Idea



* Draw IB out of M1 source
  * Quiescent point voltage at node X changes over process\, temperature\, but M1 current stays roughly constant
  * Make Clarge large enough to essentially provide a “short” to ground at minimum desired input frequency


Issue: Don’t like Clarge…

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Yet Another Idea



* Use another MOSFET \(M1’\) to provide low impedance at node X
* As before\, circuit is insensitive to changes in VI and transistor Vt
  * No large caps or resistors needed to accomplish this\!


Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Differential Pair



* The structure we arrived on the previous slide is called “differential pair\,” as its main feature is to evaluate the difference between two voltages
  * In our circuit\, these two voltages are VI and VI\+vi
  * To first order\, changes in VI and Vt do not affect the output voltage
* This circuit can be redrawn more generally as shown to the right
  * We’ll do a detailed analysisnext lecture…
