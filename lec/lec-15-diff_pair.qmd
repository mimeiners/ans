# Significance



* The differential pair is the most widely used two\-transistor circuit in integrated circuits
  * Many circuits rely on the “computation” of the difference between two voltages

# General Analysis of the Differential Pair



* When Vip=Vim\, and both transistors are identical\, we must have Id1=Id2=ITAIL/2
* How about Vip=Vim=1V versus Vip=Vim=2V?
  * Makes no difference\!
* From a signal perspective\, we care only about the difference of the applied voltages
  * Makes sense to introduce a new variable
    * Vid=\(Vip\-Vim\)


# Differential and Common Mode (1)



* We now still need a second variable that describes the potential of nodes Vip and Vim with respect to GND
  * Could choose either Vip or Vim
* More elegant solution
  * Cut Vid in half and define a new independent variable
  * "Common mode" voltage Vic


# Coupling Noise Immunity

Single Ended Signaling

Differential Signaling

Similar arguments can be made regarding the rejection of supply variation\, ground bounce\, etc\.

# Large Signal Transfer Function (1)

We can turn this into a more elegant expression by using

where VOV is the quiescent point gate overdrive with Vid=0



* This equation predicts
  * Iod/ITAIL = 0 when Vid=0\, as expected
  * Complete current steering \(Iod/ITAIL=±1\) takes place when Vid= ±VOV√2


# Large Signal Plot



* Note that the equation on previous slide is only valid in the center of this transfer function \(between saturation points\)
  * Why?


# Observations



* Looks like something we have seen before
  * A transfer function that is somewhat linear as long as Vid<<VOV
* For small signal analysis\, we can find an equivalent transconductance by differentiation at the operating point


Note that the transconductance of M1 and M2 is given by

# Does the Tail Node Move?



* From this expression\, we see that from a small signal perspective the tail node is pinned at Vic\-Vt\-VOV
  * "AC ground"


# Small Signal Equivalent



* Sufficient to work with half circuit\!
  * Can directly apply everything we've learned about single transistor stage
* Half circuit caveats
  * Cannot analyze nonlinearity using half circuits
  * Assumes that M1 and M2 are identical


# Differential Voltage Amplifier Example

# Voltage Amplifier Transfer Functions

In a differential amplifier\, we primarily want to have large gain that links only the two differential variables

Unfortunately\, circuit nonidealities will also cause nonzero "parasitic" gain terms

# Common Mode Gain

Ideally zero \(RTAIL=∞\)

With finite RTAIL:

# Common Mode Rejection Ratio



* Figure of merit that quantifies ratio of desired/undesired gain
  * Ideally infinite


For our simple resistively loaded differential pair\, this becomes \(assuming R<<ro and ignoring body effect\)

Other important figures of merit

# Power Supply Rejection Ratio



* In practice\, "noise" on the supplies will also propagate to the output
  * In a differential system usually due to \(half\-\) circuit imbalance
* Define


# Input Referred Interpretation



* E\.g\. 1mV input signal\, 100mV supply noise
  * Need PSRR >> 100 \(40dB\)
* PSRR can be a very critical issue in highly integrated\, complex integrated circuits
  * Lots of potential supply noise sources
    * E\.g\. cross\-talk between analog and digital sections
