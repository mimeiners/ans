# Lecture 16Fundamentals of Feedback

# Negative Feedback

Harold S\. Black\, 1927

Interesting case:

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Interpretation



* As long as we have "large" gain in the forward path a\, the overall  gain will depend only on f
* Since vout/vin ~1/f\, we often make f ≤ 1
  * E\.g\. for a "closed loop" gain of two\, we need f=0\.5
* f≤1 is easy to implement\, and ratiometric\!
  * A "wire" \(f=1\) or resistive or capacitive voltage divider

# Example

Case 1: a=1000

Case 2: a=100

10 x variation in forward gain\, and only about 1\.8% change in closed loop gain\!

# Gain Sensitivity



* Define
* Can show that
* Fractional change in gain is reduced by product of a and f\, which can be made arbitrarily large \(conceptually\)
  * Loop gain T
* We will find that loop gain is a very meaningful parameter that will also appear in bandwidth and impedance calculations
  * More later …

# Effect of Negative Feedback on Nonlinearity

Substitute eq\. \(2\) into eq\. \(1\)\, then compare coefficients to get

Linear term as expected\, reduced by \(1\+T\)

Cubic term reduced by \(1\+T\)4\!

# Negative Feedback and Bandwidth

Closed loop transfer function:



* Bandwidth increases by \(1\+T\)\!
  * But gain is reduced by \(1\+T\)
* Product of gain and bandwidth remains constant

# Early Obstacles



* Today we are taking the concept of negative feedback for granted
* At the time of his "invention\," Harold Black had a hard time convincing his colleagues that negative feedback was indeed something useful
  * It was very hard to make a "high gain" forward amplifier using vacuum tubes\.
  * Why have large gain and then throw it away by applying negative feedback?
* Long before negative feedback had been deemed useful\, positive feedback was routinely applied to increase the gain of amplifiers

# Positive Feedback

Edwin H\. Armstrong\, 1915

Example

Tenfold increase in gain\!

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Armstrong: Genius and Showman



* Positive Feedback has stability issues …\(so did Armstrong\)
* But\, he was a genius and inventor with few peers:
  * FM \(radio\)
  * Heterodyning \(freq\. translation\)

# Feedback Using Ideal Opamp

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Inverting Configuration



* Circuit does not map directly into generic block diagram
  * Cannot directly identify a and f\, if we only use voltages    \(due to fact that O/A is voltage\-voltage; the feedback is current as a function of output voltage\)
  * av ≠ g
  * Two sample solutions \(examples = not yet methodology\)

# Sample Solution 1 - OpAmp Virtual Ground

_Ideal _  _OpAmp_  _ Version_ :

KCL at  _virtual ground_  node

Vin/R1= \- Vout/R2

_ Gain_ :

Vout/Vin= \- R2/R1But\, what if it’s not an ideal OpAmp?

# Inverting Configuration

# Result



* It can be quite tedious to try and morph arbitrary circuits into a generic "af" block diagram
  * Especially when impedances come into play \(and with MOS they certainly do\)
* Elegant alternative: "Return Ratio Analysis"
  * More next lecture …

# A word about OpAmps versus OTAs (1)

# Opamps versus OTAs (2)

Opamp

"General Purpose"

Ideally a voltage controlled voltage source

Low output impedance

Can drive resistive and capacitive loads

Essentially OTA \+ buffer

Buffer increases complexity and  _power_  dissipation

OTA

Most  _on\-chip amplifiers_  are OTAs

Ideally a voltage controlled current source

High output impedance

Difficult to drive resistive loads

Use capacitive \(switched capacitor\) feedback network

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Integrated Circuit Example

E\.g\. switched capacitor A/D Converter for audio applications

OTAs see capacitive loads only  high gain is maintained without the need for output buffers

More on switched capacitor circuits in AMCD and CEMS \(MScEE\)
