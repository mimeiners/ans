# Effects of Feedback

_Gain Stability_ : Feedback reduces sensitivity of gain to variations in values of transistor parameters and other circuit elements\.

_Input and Output Impedances_ : Feedback can increase or decrease input and output resistances of an amplifier\.

_Bandwidth_ : Bandwidth of an amplifier can be extended using feedback\.

_Nonlinear Distortion:_  Feedback reduces effects of nonlinear distortion\.  eg: removal of dead zone in class\-B amplifiers

# Classic Feedback Systems

T  = loop gain = A

For negative feedback: T\(s\) > 0

For positive feedback: T\(s\) < 0

_A_  = transfer function of open\-loop amplifier or open\-loop gain\.

_b_  = transfer function of feedback network\.

# Gain Error and Fractional Gain Error

Gain Error is given by

GE = \(ideal gain\) \- \(actual gain\)

For non\-inverting amplifier\,

Gain error is also expressed as a fractional or percentage error\.

# Loop Gain CalculationSuccessive Voltage and Current Injection

Measurement of the open\-loop characteristics of very high gain op amps is virtually impossible in the laboratory

SPICE simulation of the open\-loop characteristics is also problematic

The successive Voltage and Current Injection method is a closed\-loop technique that can be used determine the open\-loop gain and frequency response of many amplifiers

Two sets of measurements are utilized: voltage injection & current injection

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_53.jpg)

Voltage injection: Voltage   source vX is inserted at an arbitrary point P in circuit\.

Current injection: Current source iX is then inserted at P\.

# Successive Voltage and Current InjectionSimplifications

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_55.jpg)

Technique is valid even if source resistances of  _v_  _X_  and  _i_  _X_  are included in the analysis\.

If at P\,  _R_  _B_  is zero or  _R_  _A_  is infinite\,  _T _ can be found by only one measurement and  _T _  =  _T_  _v_  \. In ideal op amp circuits\, such point often exists at op amp input\.

If  _R_  _A_  = 0 or  _R_  _B_  is infinite\,  _T _  =  _T_  _I_  \.

In practice\, if  _R_  _B_  >>  _R_  _A_  or  _R_  _A_  >>  _R_  _B_ \, the simplified expressions can be used\.

# Op Amp Frequency ResponseSingle-pole Amplifiers

Op amps: General purpose op amps are typically low\-pass amplifiers with high gain at dc and a single\-pole frequency response\.

wB = open loop bandwidth of the op amp\.  __w__  __T__  =  __unity gain frequency__  or  __gain bandwidth product__  \(frequency at which magnitude of gain is unity\)\.

For w >> wB\, the product of magnitude of amplifier gain and frequency is a constant value equal to the unity\-gain frequency\.

Hence\, wT is also called the gain\-bandwidth product\.

# Large Signal LimitationsSlew Rate and Full-Power Bandwidth

Slew rate: Maximum rate of change of voltage at the output of an op amp\.  Typical values range from 0\.1V/ms to 10V/ms\.

For given frequency\, slew rate limits the maximum signal amplitude that can be amplified without distortion\.

For no signal distortion\,

Full\-power bandwidth is highest frequency at which a full\-scale signal can be developed\.

# Operational AmplifierMacro Model for Frequency Response

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_77.jpg)

Simplified circuit representations are available in most simulators to model the terminal behavior of op amps that include all nonideal limitations of op amps and a large number of parameters that can be adjusted to model op amp behavior\.

To model a single\-pole roll\-off\, an auxiliary “dummy” loop \(voltage controlled voltage source  _v_ 1 in series with  _R _ and  _C_ \) is added to the original two\-port model\.

The RC product is chosen to give the desired \-3dB point for the open\-loop amplifier\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityUse of Nyquist Plot to Determine Stability

If gain of amplifier is greater than or equal to 1 at the frequency where feedback is positive\, instability can arise\.

Poles are at frequencies where  _T\(s\) _ = \-1\.

In Nyquist plots\, each value of  _s_  in the  _s_ \-plane has corresponding value of  _T\(s\)\._

Values of  _s _ on  _j_  _w_  axis are plotted\.

If \-1 point is enclosed by boundary\, there is some value of  _s _ for which  _T\(s\) _ = \-1\, a pole exists in RHP and the amplifier is unstable\.

If \-1 point lies outside the interior of the Nyquist plot\, all poles of the closed\-loop amplifier are in the LHP and the amplifier is stable\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityFirst-Order Systems

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_80.jpg)

At dc\, T\(0\) = To \, but for w >>1\,

As w increases\, the magnitude monotonically approaches zero and phase asymptotically approaches \-90o\.

As b changes\, the value of T\(0\) = To is scaled\.  As T\(0\) changes\, the radius of the circle changes\, but it can never encloses the \-1 point\, so the amplifier is stable regardless of value of To\.

For a simple low\-pass amplifier\,

It can also represent a single\-pole op amp with resistive feedback\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilitySecond-Order Systems

As w increases\, the magnitude monotonically decreases from 14 towards zero and the phase asymptotically approaches \-180o\.   The transfer function can never enclose the \-1 point\, but it can come arbitrarily close to it\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityPhase Margin

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_82.jpg)

where

First we determine frequency for which magnitude of loop gain is unity\, corresponding to intersection of the Nyquist plot with unit circle\, and then determine phase shift at this frequency\. Difference between this angle and \-1800 is phase margin\.

Small phase margin causes excessive peaking in closed\-loop frequency response and ringing in step response\.

__Phase Margin__  is the maximum increase in phase shift that can be tolerated before the system becomes unstable\.

For

T\(0\) =7\, but for high frequencies

As w increases\, the polar plot asymptotically approaches zero along the positive imaginary axis\.  The plot can enclose the \-1 point under many circumstances and the system is unstable\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityGain Margin

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_84.jpg)

If the magnitude of T\(jw\) is increased by a factor equal to or exceeding the gain margin\, then the closed\-loop system becomes unstable\, because the Nyquist plot then encloses the \-1 point\.

__Gain Margin__  is the reciprocal of magnitude of T\(jw\) evaluated at frequency for which the phase shift is 180o\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityBode Plots - Phase and Gain Margin

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_85.jpg)

At 1\.2 Mrad/s\, the magnitude of the loop gain is unity and the corresponding phase shift is 145o\.   Phase margin is given by 180o \- 145o = 35o\.  The amplifier can tolerate additional phase shift of 35o before it becomes unstable\.

At 3\.2 Mrad/s\, the phase shift is exactly 180o and the corresponding magnitude of the loop gain is  \-17 dB\.  Phase margin is given by 17 dB\.  The amplifier gain must increase by 17 dB before the amplifier becomes unstable\.

# Feedback Amplifier StabilityUse of Bode plot to Determine Stability

![](img/lec-18b-MCD6thEdChap11_86.jpg)

Frequency at which curves corresponding to magnitudes of open\-loop gain and reciprocal of feedback factor intersect is the point at which loop gain is unity\, phase margin is found from phase plot\.

Assuming feedback is independent of frequency\,

For 1/b = 80 dB\, fm= 85o\, amplifier is stable\.

For 1/b = 50 dB\, fm= 15o\, amplifier is stable\, but with significant overshoot and ringing in its step response\.

For 1/b = 0 dB\, fm= \-45o\, amplifier is unstable
