# Lecture 8OTA Behaviour

# Settling Performance

In switched capacitor circuits the amplifier is subjected to transient pulses

Output must ‘settle’ within the ϕ2 clock phase\, so that a proper voltage level is sampled on CL

Note:

Replace Cf with Cftot = Cf \+ Cgd in all of the following expressions if there is extra feedback capacitance \(due to Cgd\) inside the OTA

# Design Considerations



* Need large DC loop gain for small static error
  * |e0| ≅ 1/T0
  * E\.g\. need T0 > 1000 for better than 0\.1% precision
* Need small t \(large bandwidth\) for fast settling
* Can define “settling time” based on tolerable dynamic error

Going from 1% dynamic precision to 10\-6 necessitates only ~3x increase in settling time

  * Using inverse Laplace transform of A\(s\) with high frequency zero included
* Recall that A\(s\) is more precisely given by

# New Settling Time



* Settling time for given precision increases due to feedforward\, since the settling range is artificially enlarged
* E\.g\.\, in our simulation example\, the time to settle within 0\.1% dynamic error increases from 6\.9τ to 7\.3τ
  * Not all that significant\, especially when β is low and CL is at least comparable to Cf

# Slewing



* During  <span style="color:#008000">slewing</span> \, the amplifier drives its output with an approximately constant current \(equal to tail bias\)\.
* The slewing behavior ends when |Vid| has become smaller than about
* This is the point when the differential pair re\-enters its  <span style="color:#008000">linear region</span> \.Hence\, the remaining portion of the settling is often called <span style="color:#008000">linear settling</span> \. _Note that this is not meant to say that the output changes with a constant rate during this time; it settles with a \(1\-e_  _t/_  _τ_  _\) relationship_  _\._
* The total settling time of the amplifier in presence of slewing can be calculated as shown in the following derivation\.


Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Slew Rate

In order to find the time it takes to complete slewing\, we can first calculate the "ramp speed" at which the output changes\.

This quantity is called "Slew Rate" \(SR\)\.

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Slewing Time

The input of the differential pair changes at a rate equal to           \,where      is given by the usual capacitive feedback divider\.

Hence\, the time it takes to complete slewing is given by

In our example\, we have:

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Subsequent Linear Settling

Once slewing is completed\, the differential output voltage is



* The final settling value in our example is roughly 1V
  * Almost half way there after slewing
* This means that the dynamic error budget for the remaining settling portion \(Vod\,lin\) has increased
  * E\.g\. if we wanted to settle within 0\.1% of the final value \(~1V\)\, we only need to complete the remaining transient to within 0\.1%·1V/0\.58V = 0\.17%
  * Not a very big win\, usually a negligible change in the number of required time constants0\.1%  6\.9τ versus 0\.17%  6\.4τ


Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Complete Expression for Settling Time



* Note that circuits with large closed loop gain tend to slew less
  * Since Vid\,step cannot be larger than Vod\,final/Gain
  * E\.g\. Vod\,final=2V\, Gain =8  Vxdstep < Vidstep < 250mVThe circuit won’t slew at all as long as gm/ID < 2\.8/250mV = 11\.2 S/A


Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Design Considerations



* When slewing is an issue\, it can be mitigated by biasing the relevant transistors at lower gm/ID
  * Increase ID\, keep gm constant
  * Slewing performance improves\, because of larger ID and also because the differential pair input range increases \(2\.8/\(gm/ID\)\)
  * Small signal performance remains virtually unchanged or improves if fT is a limiting factor \(since fT increases\)
  * Issue
    * Lower gm/ID means higher power consumption

# Output Swing of Simple OTA

Available output swing depends on input and output common mode levels

May be limited by headroom for differential pair device \(Vminn\) or active load \(Vminp\)

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Maximum Available Swing



* Input and output common mode adjusted such that all devices operate at "edge" of active region
  * Well defined using long channel model\, very gradual transition in short channels
* Unfortunately\, the choice of Vic and Voc are often dictated by the circuits that interface with the amplifier
  * E\.g\. Vic=Voc=1\.5V


Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Example Vic=Voc=VDD/2

Assuming that we are limited by Vminn\, and Vminn~VOV\, the available differential peak\-to\-peak swing is ~4Vt

Since the transition to triode is smooth\, which criterion should we use find the "exact" output range of an amplifier?

# Gain vs. Output Swing DC Simulation

In AMCD\, we arbitrarily define output range as the peak\-to\-peak swing that causes no more than 30% drop in Vod/Vid\.

# Example: fp2 = 5fc



* Phase margin approx\. 80 deg\.
  * Non\-dominant pole p2 is not an issue in this case
* Since wp2 approx\. wT/3\, this means that wc \(and hence closed\-loop BW\) cannot be higher than ~wT/15 in this scenario

# Example: fp2 = fc/5



* Phase margin approx\. 28 deg\.
  * Not acceptable in practice
* How much phase margin should we design for?

# Phase Margin as a Function of ωp2

At the crossover frequency\, the dominant pole has shifted the phase by about \-90 deg\.

The non\-dominant pole's phase at ωc is given by arctan\(ωc/ωp2\)\.

Typically want to shoot for phase margin ~70\-75 degrees\.

| ωp2/ωc | Approximate PM |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 45 deg\. |
| 2 | 63 deg\. |
| 3 | 72 deg\. |
| 4 | 76 deg\. |
| 5 | 79 deg\. |

# Load Compensation



* Non\-dominant pole is fixed at roughly ωT/3
* The loop crossover frequency is given by
* Increasing CLtot will lower wc and increase ωp2/ωc\, which translates into larger phase margin\.
* A feedback circuit in which adding additional load capacitance improves stability is often called “load compensated”
  * Meaning that the load compensates or reduces the impact of phase shift from p2\.

# How Fast Can We Go?



* Let’s say we design for fc ~ 1/3 fp2 ~ 1/9 fT
* At a reasonable bias\, the NMOS transit frequency in 0\.18um technology is roughly 20 GHz \(nominal process and temperature\)\.
* Assume 0\.01% settling and no slewing
* In practice\, it is hard to go any faster than 200 MHz in 0\.18um technology:
  * Slewing
  * Timing overhead \(have somewhat less time than Ts/2\)
  * Margins for process variation\, wiring caps\, etc\.

# How Much Gain Can We Get?

Small\-signal gain \(around Vid=Vod=0\)

e\.g\. a0n=a0p=50\, \(gm/ID\)n= \(gm/ID\)p   a0=25

Static gain error ~1/To ~1/a0 ~1/25 = 4%

Not precise enough for many applications\.

# Noise in Differential Circuits



* In differential circuits\, the noise power is doubled \(because there are two half circuits contributing to the noise\)
* But\, the signal power increases by 4 times\. Looks like a 3\-dB win?
* Yes\, there’s a 3\-dB win in DR\, but it comes at twice the power dissipation \(due to two half circuits\)\.
* Can get the same DR/power in a single ended circuit by doubling all cap sizes and gm\.
