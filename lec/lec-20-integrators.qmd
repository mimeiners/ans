# Amplifier Model with First Order Nonidealities

# RC Integrator with Nonideal Amplifier

Using return ratio analysis\, we can write

As long as T\(s\) is large\, the transfer function A\(s\) is close to the desired ideal transfer function \(A∞\)

# a0∞, ωu=100ω0

# a0=10,000, wu∞

# a0=10,000, ωu=100ω0

# RC Integrator with Finite ωu

Ignoring finite DC gain for the time being\, i\.e\. using

The equations from slide 4 yield for this case

The first error term modifies only the magnitude\, and effectively alters the integration time constant \(RC = 1/ω0\)

# Significance of ω0 (Biquad Example)

Integrator ω0 typically not too far off from pole frequency ωP

# Baseline Requirement for ωu

High\-Q filters will be sensitive to variations and uncertainty in the  “effective” value of ω0

In a practical design\, we therefore require ωu >> ω0\, typically ωu = 10…50 ω0

Assuming that we comply with this guideline\, we are left with

# Effect on Filter Response

For a filter that uses ideal integrators\, we know that

For the case with finite ωu

and therefore

# Solving for pactual (1)

Equating real and imaginary parts\, we find

To proceed\, it makes sense to customize the analysis for high\-Q poles\, which should represent the most critical case

We can now simplify using to obtain

Negligible change in the pole’s imaginary part;real part affected by finite ωu

# Effect on Pole Locations

Example for QPideal = 30\, <2% \(0\.17dB\) increase in QPactual

# Corresponding Phase Error

we can estimate the phase error of the integrator at w0 using

# Pole-Zero Cancellation (1)

We can achieve “ideal” operation by letting

Assuming ωu >> ω0\, this is accomplished for



* In high\-speed filters\, this trick typically helps reduce the amplifier bandwidth requirements by more than an order of magnitude
  * Note that the requirements do not drop to “zero” because we still need to maintain ωu >> ω0
* Practicality issue: How to ensure that RZ tracks variations in wu and C\, for both global variations and random mismatch errors


# Auxiliary Amplifiers



* No \(good\) way to cancel error from inverting or summing amplifiers
  * But these amplifiers also contribute to the overall phase shift


# “Tweaking” a Tow-Thomas Biquad



* May be able to cancel the phase error from all stages by introducing a “strategically” tuned zero\.
  * Practicality questionable

# RC Integrator with Finite Gain

# Effect on Filter Response

For the case of finite gain\, we can therefore write

For the case of high\-Q poles\, it can then be shown that

Example for Qpideal = 30\, <2% \(0\.17dB\) decrease in QPactual

# Summary



* Finite amplifier bandwidth leads to QP enhancement
  * Typically seen as excess peaking in the filter’s magnitude response
* Finite amplifier gain leads to QP degradation
  * Typically seen as droop in the filter’s magnitude response


# Noise in Active RC Lowpass

\(noise due to resistors only\)

# Amplifier Noise Analysis (1)

Solving for vout/vn yields

Note: The same result can be obtained by approximating vout/vn as a single pole response before carrying out the integral\.

# Total Noise for Active RC Filter



* Amplifier noise contribution is large for large wu/w0
  * But\, unfortunately\, we need ωu >> ω0 to maintain an accurate transfer function
* Given that we need ωu >> ω0 \, the only option we have is to choose Rnoise << R to minimize amplifier noise
  * In a transistor\-level implementation\, this requires large gm \(and large IBIAS\)\, since Rnoise ~ 1/gm


# Frequency Response with Finite ωu

# Amplifier Noise Contribution (Rnoise=0.1R)

# Active Second Order Lowpass

\(after some algebra\)

# Analysis

For high QP\, we definitely need to make R << Rx

# Optimum

In a properly designed filter \(and for large QP\,\) the noise will be roughly proportional to QP

For a poorly designed filter\, the noise can be proportional to QP2

# Summary



* The total integrated thermal noise of filter circuits is related to capacitor size
  * Usually a multiple of kT/C
* In filters\, noise is proportional to the filter order\, QP\, and strongly dependent on the implementation
* Amplifiers can contribute significantly to \(if not dominate the\) overall filter noise
  * Minimizing the amplifier noise contribution costs power
    * Need small Rnoise\, i\.e\. large gm \(IBIAS\)


# Alternative Integrator Realizations



* Thus far\, we have primarily employed active RC integrators in our filter implementations
* Next\, we’ll consider a number of alternative implementations that have found their use in practice
  * MOSFET\-Opamp\-C
  * Gm\-OTA\-C
  * Gm\-C


# MOSFET-C Integrator



* MOSFET in triode used to replace resistor
* Advantages
  * Continuous tuning mechanism for integratortime constant
  * Potentially cheaper fabrication process
* Disadvantages
  * Large parasitics\, distributed RC along channel
  * Bias point sensitivity
  * Weakly nonlinear


# Gm-Opamp-C Integrator



* Transconductor replaces resistor
  * Built e\.g\. using a differential pair
* Advantages
  * Main amplifier sees only capacitive loads\,can replace with “OTA”
  * Continuous tuning mechanism for integrator time constant\, e\.g\. via IBIAS of Gm cell
  * Potentially cheaper process
* Disadvantages
  * Nonlinearity of Gm cell
  * Extra power dissipation


# OpAmps versus OTAs (1)

__Operational __  __Transconductance__  __ Amplifier__

__Operational Amplifier__



* __OpAmp__
* "General Purpose"
* Low output impedance
  * Ideally a voltage controlled voltage source
* Can drive resistive and capacitive loads
* Essentially an OTA \+ buffer
  * Buffer increases complexity and power dissipation
* __OTA__
* Mostly used “on\-chip”
* High output impedance
  * Ideally a voltage controlled current source
* Not well suited for resistive loads\, mostly used to drive capacitive loads
* Usually lower \(total integrated\) noise


# Loading Considerations (1)



* Low load resistance will "destroy" the gain of our amplifier
  * RL may be an explicit load or due to loading from the feedback network
* But\, we want large \(loop\) gain for good precision
* __Single\-ended OTA model__




* Adding a buffer allows us to drive resistive loads and still achieve high gain
* But
  * Buffer can be difficult to build
  * Is costly in terms of headroom \(e\.g\. source follower\)
  * Adds additional area\, power
* __Single\-ended __  __OpAmp__  __ model__




* Resistive load "destroys" gain of second stage only
  * First stage sees capacitive load
* Costs additional area\, power and must sacrifice stage 2 gain
* Can work acceptably well for moderate resistive loads
  * More later


__Single\-ended model of a two\-stage OTA__

# Gm-C Integrator



* Advantages
  * No OTA\, no op\-amp\!
    * Lower power
    * Less phase shift\!
  * Continuous tuning mechanism for integrator time constant
    * Via IBIAS of Gm cell
* Disadvantages
  * Nonlinearity of Gm cell
  * Sensitive to finite output resistance \(Ro\)
  * Sensitive to parasitics
