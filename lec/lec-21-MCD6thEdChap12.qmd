# Cascaded Amplifiers

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_1.jpg)

Connecting several amplifiers in cascade \(output of one stage connected to input of the next\) can meet design specifications not met by a single amplifier

Each amplifier is built by using an op amp with parameters  _A\, R_  _id_  _\, R_  _o_ \, called open\-loop parameters that describe the op amp with no external elements\.

_A_  _v_  _\, _  _R_  _in_  _\, R_  _out_  are closed\-loop parameters that describe both the  closed\-loop op amp with the feedback network as well as the overall composite \(cascaded\) amplifier\.

# Cascaded Amplifier Frequency Response

Bandwidth of the cascade amplifier is the frequency at which gain is reduced by \-3 dB from its low frequency value\.

# Op Amp CircuitsThe Instrumentation Amplifier

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_4.jpg)

The Instrumentation Amplifier combines 2 non\-inverting amplifiers with a difference amplifier to provide higher gain and lower input resistance

The input resistance is infinite because input current to both op amps is zero\. The output resistance is set to zero by the difference amplifier\.

Single\-pole filter                            Two\-pole filter

Active filters use feedback amplifiers to realize filters without the use of inductors that are difficult to realize in integrated circuit form\.

We encountered the single\-pole low\-pass filter in Chapter 10\.

However\, other circuit forms are more “efficient” in the sense they can achieve two or more poles of filtering per op amp\.

The transfer function is:

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_7.jpg)

In standard form\,

Op amp operates as a voltage follower with unity gain over a wide range of frequencies\.

Uses positive feedback through  _C_ 1 at frequencies above dc to realize complex poles without inductors\.

Feedback connection provides dc path for the amplifier’s input bias currents\.

Circuits are often designed with        C1 = C2 = C\.

# Active FiltersLow-pass Filter Frequency Response

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_8.jpg)

For Q = 0\.71\, the magnitude response is maximally flat \(Butterworth Filter: Maximum bandwidth without peaking\)

For Q > 0\.71\, response shows undesired peaking\.

For Q < 0\.71: Filter’s bandwidth capability is wasted\.

Sensitivity\,       represents fractional change in parameter P due to a given fractional change in the value of Z\.   For this filter\, the sensitivity of  ωo with respect to R and C is:

For w << wo\, filter has unity gain\.

For w >> wo\, the response exhibits a two\-pole roll\-off at 40dB/decade\.

At w = wo\, filter gain = Q\.

Jaeger/Blalock/Blalock

Microelectronic Circuit Design\, 6E McGraw\-Hill

# Active FiltersTwo-pole Low-pass Filter (Example)

__Problem:__  Design second\-order low\-pass filter with maximally flat response\.

__Given data:__   _f_  _H_  = 5 kHz

__Analysis:__  _C_ 1 = 2 _C_ 2 = 2 _C _ and _ R_ 1 =  _R_ 2 =  _R_ \.

1/woC  is the reactance of C at wo\, R is 30% smaller than this value\. Thus impedance level of the filter is set by C\. If the impedance level is too low\, the op amp will not be able to supply current required to drive feedback network\.   At 5 kHz\, for a 0\.01 mF capacitor\,

Final values: R1 = R2 = 2\.26 kW\, C1 = 0\.02 mF\, C2 = 0\.01 mF

# Active FiltersHigh-pass Filter with Gain

The transfer function is:

For R1 = R2 = R  and C1 = C2 = C\,

Voltage follower in low\-pass filter replaced by non\-inverting amplifier with gain K\, which gives an added degree of freedom in design\.

dc paths exist for both op amp input bias currents through R2 and the feedback resistors\.

For K = 3\, Q is infinite\, and the poles are on the jw axis causing sinusoidal oscillations\. K > 3 causes instability due to right\-half plane poles\.

# Active FiltersHigh-pass Filter Frequency Response

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_10.jpg)

For  _Q _ = 0\.71\, the magnitude response is maximally flat \(Butterworth Filter response\)\.

Response peaks at  _w_  _o_  and gain at center frequency is 2 _Q_ 2\.

For  _w _  _<<_  _w_  _o_  or  _w _  _>>_  _w_  _o_ \, filter response corresponds to single\-pole high\-pass or low\-pass filter changing at a rate of 20dB/decade\.

# Active FiltersTow-Thomas Biquad

The general biquadratic transfer function can represent low\-pass\, high\-pass\, band\-pass\, all\-pass and notch filters:

In the Tow\-Thomas biquad\, the first op amp  is a multi\-input integrator and the third is simply an inverter\.

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_14.jpg)

Thus\, the center frequency\, Q and gain can each be adjusted independently\.

The Tow\-Thomas Biquad can achieve all filter functions with the addition of extra passive components as shown\.

Jaeger/Blalock/Blalock

Microelectronic Circuit Design\, 6E McGraw\-Hill

# Active FiltersTow-Thomas Biquad (Example)

__Problem:__  Design a band\-pass filter using the Tow\-Thomas circuit

__Given data:__   _f_  _o_  = 2 kHz\, BW = 200 Hz\, midband gain = 20

__Unknowns:__   _R\, R_ 1\,  _R_ 2\,  _R_ 3\,  _C_

__Analysis:__

Input resistance to the filter is set by R1\.  The first op amp must supply ac signal current to the parallel combination of R\, R2\, and C\.  The second op amp must drive the parallel combination of R3 and C\.  The third must drive R3 in parallel with R\.  After some thought about the various values\, we choose C = 2700 pF\,

R3 can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it doesn’t load down second and third op amps\. R3 = 49\.9 kW

# Active FiltersMagnitude Scaling

The magnitude of the filter impedances may all be increased or decreased by a magnitude scaling factor  _K_  _M_  without changing  _w_  _o_  or  _Q_  of the filter\.

# Active FiltersFrequency Scaling

Cutoff or center frequencies of a filter may be scaled by a frequency scaling factor  _K_  _F_  _ _ without changing the  _Q_  of the filter if each capacitor value is divided by  _K_  _F_  and resistor values are left unchanged\.

# Switched-Capacitor Circuits

Switched\-capacitor \(SC\) circuits eliminate resistors in filters by replacing them with capacitors and switches\.

The resulting filters are discrete\-time or sampled\-data equivalents of the continuous\-time filters discussed so far\.

SC filters provide additional flexibility not readily available in continuous\-time form\, such as inversion of signal polarity without using an amplifier\.

SC circuits are compatible with high density MOS IC processes\.

SC circuits provide filters and CMOS ICs for signal processing and communications applications\.

# Equivalence Between SC Integrator and Continuous Time Integrator

Consider total charge  _Q_  _s _ flowing from source  _v_  _s_  through resistor  _R_  during clock period  _T_ \.

Equating this charge to charge stored on  _C_  _1 _

_	_ where  _f_  _C_  _ _ is the clock frequency\.

For a capacitance of 1 pF and switching frequency of 100 kHz\, the   equivalent resistance is 10 MW\, which is much larger than resistor values that can normally be realized in ICs\.

In Phase 1\, the source is connected to summing junction of op amp\, and charge C1Vs is delivered to C2\.  Node 1 is driven by and node 2 is kept at zero\.

During Phase 2\, the source is disconnected\, the output is constant\, and C1 is totally discharged\.  Any stray capacitances at nodes 1 or 2 don’t introduce errors into charge transfer process\.

# Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Converters Fundamentals

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_27.jpg)

In a DAC\, an  _n_ \-bit binary input word \( _b_ 1\, _b_ 2\,… _b_ n\) is combined with a reference voltage  _V_ REF to give the output of the DAC\.

Full\-scale voltage  _V_ FS is related to  _V_ REF of the converter by K where

K determines the converter gain that is commonly set to 1\.

Microelectronic Circuit Design\, 6E McGraw\-Hill

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_28.jpg)

_V_ OS\, the offset voltage of the converter characterizes the DAC output when the digital input code is zero\.  The offset voltage is normally adjusted to zero\.

The smallest voltage change at the DAC output occurs when the LSB  _b_ n in the digital word changes from a 0 to 1 and is also called resolution\.

_b_ 1\, the MSB has a weight of one\-half  _V_ FS\.

# D/A Converter SpecificationsOffset and Gain Errors

Maximum output of ideal converter is always 1 LSB smaller than  _V_ FS\.

For an ideal DAC characteristic\,  0\.875  _V_ FS corresponds to maximum output code of 111\.

__Gain error__  of converter represents deviation of slope of converter transfer function from that of the corresponding ideal DAC\.

He ideal DAC has been calibrated so that  _V_ OS = 0 and 1 LSB is  _V_ FS /8\.

__Offset voltage__  is the output of converter for zero binary input code\.

# D/A Converter SpecificationsLinearity Errors

__Integral linearity error or linearity error __ measures the deviation of an actual converter output from a straight line fitted to the converter output voltages\, specified as a fraction of LSB\.

Overall linearity error is the magnitude of the largest error that occurs\.  A good converter has linearity error < 0\.5 LSB

__Differential linearity error__  is the magnitude of the maximum difference between each output step of  a converter and the ideal step size of 1 LSB\.

Integral linearity error for a given binary input is the sum \(integral\) of the differential linearity errors for inputs up through the given input\.

# D/A Converter Specifications Monotonicity

If the output of the DAC fails to increase in a monotonic manner as the input code is increased\, the DAC is said to be non\-monotonic\.

It is possible for a monotonic converter to have a differential linearity error > 1 LSB but\, a non\-monotonic converter always has a differential linearity error  > 1 LSB

A non\-monotonic characteristic could lead to instability in feedback systems employing such a converter

# Basic D/A Converter CircuitsWeighted-Resistor DAC

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_32.jpg)

Drawbacks:

Need to have accurate resistor ratios over a wide range of resistor values\.

Switches in series with resistors require zero offset voltage and low on\-resistance\.

Current drawn form reference varies with input data pattern causing a change in voltage drop in the Thévenin equivalent source resistance of the reference leading to data\-dependent errors called superposition errors\.

Binary input data controls the switch positions\. Successive resistors are progressively weighted by a factor of 2 producing:

Linearity errors arise due to improper resistor ratios; op amp offset voltage adds to VOS of the converter\.

# Basic D/A Converter CircuitsR-2R Ladder

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_33.jpg)

The contribution of each bit is reduced by a factor of 2 going from MSB to LSB

Drawbacks:

Requires switches with low on\-resistance and zero offset voltage\.

Current drawn from reference varies depending on input data pattern\.

Avoids weighted\-resistor DAC problem of wide range of resistor values\.

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_35.jpg)

Analog switch tree connects desired tap to input of an op amp operating as a voltage follower\.

Each tap on resistor network is forced to produce a voltage greater than or equal to the taps below it \, forcing the output to increase monotonically as the digital input code increases\.

An 8\-bit version requires 256 equal\-valued resistors\, 510 switches\, and additional decoding logic\.

# Basic D/A Converter CircuitsSwitched-Capacitor DACs

Since the SC circuit consists only of capacitors and switches\, static power dissipation occurs only in the op amp\.

Dynamic switching losses do occur\.

When switch changes state\, current impulses charge/discharge network capacitors\, changing voltage on the feedback capacitor by an amount corresponding to the bit weight of the switch that changed state\.

Circuits represent direct SC analogs of weighted\-resistor and R\-2R ladder DACs but consume much less power\.

# Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converters Fundamentals

ADC takes unknown continuous analog input signal\, voltage  _v_  _X_ \, and converts it into an n\-bit binary number\, which is a binary fraction representing ratio between unknown input voltage and full\-scale voltage

For given output code\, we know that value of input voltage lies within a 1\-LSB quantization interval\.

An ideal ADC should pick bits in binary word to minimize magnitude of the quantization error  _v_  _ε_ :

Jaeger/Blalock/Blalock

Microelectronic Circuit Design\, 6E McGraw\-Hill

__Quantization error__  occurs due to initial underestimation and then overestimation of input voltage by output code\.  The first code transition is normally offset by 0\.5 LSB to provide a symmetrical quantization error\.

# A/D Converter SpecificationOffset and Gain Errors

__Differential linearity error__  is the difference between actual code step width and ideal step size of 1 LSB\.

An ADC with differential linearity error < 1 LSB has no  __missing codes__ \.

__Gain error__  is the deviation of the slope of the converter transfer function from that of a corresponding ideal ADC\.

A good ADC is  __monotonic __ with linearity error < 0\.5 LSB and no missing codes over its full temperature range\.

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_40.jpg)

__Integral linearity error or linearity error __ is deviation of code transition points from their ideal positions\.  Integral linearity error is the sum of the differential linearity errors for the  individual steps\.

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_41.jpg)

If  _v_  _X_  >  _v_ REF\, the output voltage is high corresponding to a logic 1\.

If  _v_  _X_  <  _v_ REF\, the output voltage is high corresponding to a logic 0\.

_     _  _v_ REF is a time\-dependent reference voltage\, varied until the unknown input is determined within the quantization error of the converter\.

Ideally\, the ADC logic chooses  _b_  _i_  so that

Converter architectures differ in the strategy utilized for varying  _v_  _REF_

# A/D Conversion TechniquesCounting ADC

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_42.jpg)

An n\-bit DAC is used to generate any one of 2n outputs by applying appropriate digital input word\. vX is determined by sequentially comparing it to each possible DAC output\.

Maximum conversion time occurs for a full\-scale input signal requiring 2n clock periods\.

The binary value in counter is the smallest DAC voltage larger than unknown input\, not the DAC output closest to the unknown input\.

If input varies\, binary output is accurate representation of input signal value at the instant the comparator changes state\.

Requires minimum amount of hardware\, inexpensive to implement\.

# A/D Conversion TechniquesSuccessive Approximation ADC

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_44.jpg)



  * Binary search used by SAL to determine vX
  * n\-bit conversion needs n clock periods\. Speed limited by time taken by DAC output to settle within a fraction of an LSB of VFS and by comparator to respond to input signals differing by small amounts\.
* Slowly varying input signals not changing by more than 0\.5 LSB \(VFS /2n\+1 \) during conversion time \(TT = nTC\) are acceptable\.
* For  a sinusoidal input signal with VFS p\-p amplitude\,
* To avoid this frequency limitation\, a high speed sample\-and\-hold circuit is used ahead of the successive approximation ADC\.
* Very popular ADC with fast conversion times\, used in 8\- to 16\- bit converters

Reference voltage varies linearly with a well\-defines slope from slightly below 0 to above VFS

Maximum conversion time occurs for full\-scale input signal requiring 2n clock periods\.

Counter output is value of vX at the time end\-of\-conversion signal occurs\.

# A/D Conversion TechniquesDelta Sigma ADCs

Oversampled ADCs typically sample integrator output at 8 to 512 times the Nyquist rate\.  Digital filter produces higher resolution at the Nyquist rate\.

Feedback loop attempts to force integrator output to zero\.

If M = 2m\, N/M is average value of binary bit stream at output\.  LSB is VREF/2m\.  Effective resolution is determined by the time for which the output is averaged\.

# A/D Conversion TechniquesDelta Sigma ADC - SC Implementation

Continuous\-time integrator can be replaced by SC integrator for low\-power operation\.

Charge proportional to input is added to integrator output at each sample time and  charge given by  _CV_ REF _ _ is added or subtracted at each sample depending on control sequence applied to switches\.

Single\-bit Delta\-Sigma ADCs are inherently linear due to the 1\-bit DAC\.

SC integrator suffers less from jitter than continuous\-time integrator as long as the clock interval is long enough for charge transfer to be completed

# OscillatorsBarkhausen’s Criteria for Oscillation

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_54.jpg)

For sinusoidal oscillations\,

Barkhausen’s criteria state:

Phase shift around feedback loop should be zero degrees and magnitude of loop gain must be unity\.

Loop gain greater than unity causes distorted oscillations

For sinusoidal oscillator\, poles of the closed\-loop amplifier should be at frequency  _w_  _o_  on the  _j_  _w_  axis\.

Use positive feedback through a frequency\-selective feedback network to ensure sustained oscillation at  _w_  _o_ \.

# OscillatorsAmplitude Stabilization

The loop gain of an oscillator changes due to power supply voltage\, component value or temperature changes\.

If loop gain is too small\, desired oscillation decays\, and if it is too large\, the waveform is distorted\.

Amplitude stabilization or gain control is used to automatically control the loop gain and place th epoles exactly on  _j_  _w_  axis\.

At power on\, loop gain is larger than that required for oscillation\.  As oscillation builds up\, gain is reduced to the minimum required to sustain oscillations\.

# Amplitude Stabilization in RC Oscillators  --  Method 1

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_59.jpg)

R1 is replaced by a lamp whose small\-signal resistance depends upon the temperature of bulb filament\.

If the amplitude is large\, current is large\, resistance of the lamp increases\, and gain is reduced\.  If the amplitude is small\, the lamp cools\, resistance decreases\, and loop gain increases\.  The thermal time constant of the bulb averages signal current and amplitude is stabilized\.

Thus\, when diodes are off\, op amp gain is slightly > 3 ensuring oscillation\, but\, when one diode is on\, gain is reduced to slightly < 3\.

The same method can also be used in phase shift oscillators\.

For positive signal at vo\, D1 turns on as voltage across R3 exceeds diode turn\-on voltage\.  R4 is in parallel with R3\, loop gain is reduced\.  D2 functions similarly at negative signal peak\.

# Nonlinear Circuit ApplicationsPrecision Half-Wave Rectifier

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_61.jpg)

For  _v_  _I_  > 0\,  _v_  _O_  =  _v_  _I_ \,  _i_  _ _ > 0\, diode is forward\-biased and feedback loop is closed\.  Rectification is perfect even for small input voltages\.

For  _v_  _I_  < 0\, diode is cutoff\,  _i_  _ = _ 0\,  _v_  _O_  _ _ = 0\.

Primary sources of error are gain error and offset error due to nonideal op amp\.

For negative input voltages\, output voltage  _v_ 1 is saturated at negative limit\. Large negative voltages across input can destroy unprotected op amps\.

Response time of circuit is slowed down due to slow recovery of internal circuits from saturation\.

# Nonlinear Circuit ApplicationsNon-Saturating Precision Half-Wave Rectifier

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_63.jpg)

For vI > 0\, v1 is negative \(one diode\-drop below zero\)\, D2 is forward biased\, current in R2 is zero\, vO = 0\, and D1 is reverse biased\. Feedback loop is closed through D2\.

For vI < 0\, v1 is one diode\-drop above output voltage\, diode D1 turns on\, and D2 is off\.  Circuit behaves as an inverting amplifier with gain \- R2 / R1\. Feedback loop is closed through D1 and R2\.

# Circuits with Positive FeedbackThe Comparator

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_67.jpg)

![](img/lec-21-MCD6thEdChap12_68.jpg)

The comparator is a high gain amplifier operating without feedback

For inputs >  _V_ REF\, output saturates at  _V_  _CC_ \.

For inputs <  _V_ REF\, output saturates at \- _V_  _EE_ \.

Amplifiers built for use as comparators can handle saturation at the voltage extremes  without incurring excessive internal time delays\.

For noisy inputs\, multiple transitions may occur as input signal crosses reference level\.

# Circuits with Positive FeedbackSchmitt Trigger

A Schmitt trigger uses positive feedback to achieve a bistable characteristic\.

For positive output voltages\,  _V_ REF = b _V_  _CC_ \. For positive output voltages\,  _V_ REF = \-b _V_  _EE_ \. Reference level changes when the output changes state\.

Voltage transfer characteristic exhibits hysteresis and doesn’t respond to noise voltage magnitudes smaller than the difference between the 2 threshold levels set by the reference voltage
