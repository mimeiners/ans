# The Challenge



* Way  _too many_  options available\.
* Deciding on which implementation is  <span style="color:#ff0000">best </span> may only be possible once several options have been thoroughly compared\.
  * In terms of both  <span style="color:#008000">first\-order properties and second\-order non\-idealities</span> \, which aren’t always easy to understand\.
* The following discussion starts from the most basic ideas\, and derives some of the most popular solutions used in practice\.
* For now\, we will focus on the realization of second order sections\.
  * The treatment of second order sections will help us understand\, why we may ultimately want to go for a ladder implementation\.

Experiments over the past decades have shown that device\-to\-device mismatch for properly laid out devices is typically “random” and well\-described by a Gaussian distribution\.

With zero mean and a standard deviation that depends on the process and the size of the device\.

Empirically\, the standard deviation of the mismatch between two closely spaced devices is modeled using the following expression:where           represents the area of the device\, and X is the device parameter under consideration\.

# Pole-Zero Pairing

Pairing high\-Q poles with nearby zeros is desirable from a dynamic range perspective\.

Say that the amplifier at the output of the biquad can handle a maximum signal of 1 Vpeak

If the biquad response peaks 20 dB above unity\, this means that we can only process inputs with 100 mV amplitude near the frequency of the peak \(which lies in the passband\)\.

The signal is therefore reduced relative to the thermal noise of the circuit\, which is highly undesirable\.

# Response of the Individual Sections

First\-order section

In which order should we cascade these sections?

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Biquad Ordering

Ordering the Biquads from low\-Q to high\-Q generally yields “smooth” transfer functions from the input to the intermediate nodes\, and often helps minimize harmonic distortion\, but the output will have significant noise peaking near the corner frequency due to the last stage with high\-Q\.

Reversing the ordering will allow the later stages to filter out the noise peaking near corner frequency\.  May also filter out harmonics \(but not intermodulation\)\.

In practical filter design\, it would be worthwhile giving some thoughts to the options that you may have for the ordering of the biquads\. In a non\-lowpass filter application\, inherent ac\-coupling may also be used to your advantage to suppress offset accumulation\.

# Intermediate Outputs for High-Q  Low-Q



* At first glance this looks bad\, but the noise from the high\-Q biquad is filtered before it reaches the output
  * We will revisit this situation in the context of noise analysis

# Dynamic Range Scaling

Suppose we decided that the second ordering is what we want to use for our design

In this case\, we need to think about a proper gain distribution that avoids “clipping” in the individual amplifiers

For this purpose\, we introduce gain scale factors for each section\, while keeping the overall gain constant \(K1K2K3 = 1 in this example\)

# Analysis (1)

Suppose we chose K1=K2=K3=1 and assume that we will apply single sine waves with arbitrary frequencies to the input

Since H1 has significant peaking \(|H1|max ≅ 3\.19 ≅10 dB\)\, we can guarantee proper operation only for input amplitudes up to

Since the overall gain is unity \(with no peaking above 1\)\, this means Vout swings only 314mV\, meaning that we are “wasting” available signal range

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Analysis (2)



* A more desirable outcome may be to scale K1\, K2\, K3 such that all stages utilize the maximum available swing as the input tone is swept across all frequencies
  * Note that in general\, the maximum output swings for each stage may not occur at the same frequency\.

# Arguments Against “Sinusoidal” DR Scaling



* If the input signal is wide\-band \(as in many telecommunication systems\)\, the node with peaking may not saturate due to limited signal power in that frequency region
  * May want to optimize the gain distribution based on a power spectral density “template” of the incoming signal
* Aligning the peaks for each output perfectly will require non\-integer component ratios

  * Global process variations
  * Component mismatch
* For global process variations\, we have already seen that


If all R and C vary by the same percentage\, the filter “shape” is preserved and shifted back and forth along the frequency axis

If this is a problem for the application\, we can “tune” either R or C to bring the filter response back to the desired location

# Mismatch Analysis

Suppose we had resistors and capacitors that deviate from their nominal component value \(which is subject to global variations\) by a standard deviation of 1%

Since
